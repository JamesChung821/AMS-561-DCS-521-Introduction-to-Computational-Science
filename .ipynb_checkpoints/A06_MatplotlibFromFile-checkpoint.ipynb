    "Download the files `sintest4` and `sintest4-d`\n",

    "1) Look at the files --- the first line is a comment that includes the label of each field separated by a space.  The data follows in columns.  The first column `x` is the independent variable.  The subsequent columns are all functions of `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Write a Python function that given a filename and a number `n` (=0, 1, 2, ...) reads that column of data from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Using a separate figure for each file, plot the contents of each file (all columnns from a file on the same figure), with a legend, axis labels and a title (use the filename) for the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Column number 1 (i.e., the second column) contains the exact answer and most interesting would be plotting the error (i.e., the difference between the other columns (n=2,3,...) and column 1).  Plot the errors for both files.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Instead of having two separate figures, I would like to have both plots in the same figure, nicely arranged one above the other."
