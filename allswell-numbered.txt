0 SCENE I. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
1 
2 Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black
3 COUNTESS
4 In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
5 BERTRAM
6 And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death
7 anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to
8 whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.
9 LAFEU
10 You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
11 sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
12 good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
13 worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
14 than lack it where there is such abundance.
15 COUNTESS
16 What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?
17 LAFEU
18 He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose
19 practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
20 finds no other advantage in the process but only the
21 losing of hope by time.
22 COUNTESS
23 This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that
24 'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was
25 almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
26 far, would have made nature immortal, and death
27 should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
28 king's sake, he were living! I think it would be
29 the death of the king's disease.
30 LAFEU
31 How called you the man you speak of, madam?
32 COUNTESS
33 He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
34 his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.
35 LAFEU
36 He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
37 lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
38 was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
39 could be set up against mortality.
40 BERTRAM
41 What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?
42 LAFEU
43 A fistula, my lord.
44 BERTRAM
45 I heard not of it before.
46 LAFEU
47 I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman
48 the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
49 COUNTESS
50 His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
51 overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that
52 her education promises; her dispositions she
53 inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where
54 an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
55 commendations go with pity; they are virtues and
56 traitors too; in her they are the better for their
57 simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.
58 LAFEU
59 Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
60 COUNTESS
61 'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
62 in. The remembrance of her father never approaches
63 her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
64 livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;
65 go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect
66 a sorrow than have it.
67 HELENA
68 I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
69 LAFEU
70 Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
71 excessive grief the enemy to the living.
72 COUNTESS
73 If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess
74 makes it soon mortal.
75 BERTRAM
76 Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
77 LAFEU
78 How understand we that?
79 COUNTESS
80 Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
81 In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
82 Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
83 Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
84 Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
85 Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
86 Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,
87 But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
88 That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
89 Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
90 'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
91 Advise him.
92 LAFEU
93 He cannot want the best
94 That shall attend his love.
95 COUNTESS
96 Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.
97 Exit
98 
99 BERTRAM
100 [To HELENA] The best wishes that can be forged in
101 your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable
102 to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.
103 LAFEU
104 Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of
105 your father.
106 Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU
107 
108 HELENA
109 O, were that all! I think not on my father;
110 And these great tears grace his remembrance more
111 Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
112 I have forgot him: my imagination
113 Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
114 I am undone: there is no living, none,
115 If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
116 That I should love a bright particular star
117 And think to wed it, he is so above me:
118 In his bright radiance and collateral light
119 Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
120 The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
121 The hind that would be mated by the lion
122 Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,
123 To see him every hour; to sit and draw
124 His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
125 In our heart's table; heart too capable
126 Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
127 But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
128 Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?
129 Enter PAROLLES
130 
131 Aside
132 
133 One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;
134 And yet I know him a notorious liar,
135 Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
136 Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,
137 That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
138 Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see
139 Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
140 PAROLLES
141 Save you, fair queen!
142 HELENA
143 And you, monarch!
144 PAROLLES
145 No.
146 HELENA
147 And no.
148 PAROLLES
149 Are you meditating on virginity?
150 HELENA
151 Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me
152 ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how
153 may we barricado it against him?
154 PAROLLES
155 Keep him out.
156 HELENA
157 But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,
158 in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some
159 warlike resistance.
160 PAROLLES
161 There is none: man, sitting down before you, will
162 undermine you and blow you up.
163 HELENA
164 Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
165 blowers up! Is there no military policy, how
166 virgins might blow up men?
167 PAROLLES
168 Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be
169 blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with
170 the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It
171 is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
172 preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
173 increase and there was never virgin got till
174 virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
175 metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
176 may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is
177 ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!
178 HELENA
179 I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.
180 PAROLLES
181 There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the
182 rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,
183 is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible
184 disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:
185 virginity murders itself and should be buried in
186 highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
187 offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
188 much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very
189 paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.
190 Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of
191 self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
192 canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose
193 by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make
194 itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the
195 principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!
196 HELENA
197 How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
198 PAROLLES
199 Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it
200 likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
201 lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't
202 while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.
203 Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out
204 of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just
205 like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not
206 now. Your date is better in your pie and your
207 porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,
208 your old virginity, is like one of our French
209 withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,
210 'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;
211 marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?
212 HELENA
213 Not my virginity yet [ ]
214 There shall your master have a thousand loves,
215 A mother and a mistress and a friend,
216 A phoenix, captain and an enemy,
217 A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
218 A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;
219 His humble ambition, proud humility,
220 His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
221 His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
222 Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,
223 That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--
224 I know not what he shall. God send him well!
225 The court's a learning place, and he is one--
226 PAROLLES
227 What one, i' faith?
228 HELENA
229 That I wish well. 'Tis pity--
230 PAROLLES
231 What's pity?
232 HELENA
233 That wishing well had not a body in't,
234 Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
235 Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
236 Might with effects of them follow our friends,
237 And show what we alone must think, which never
238 Return us thanks.

242 Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.
243 Exit
244 
245 PAROLLES
246 Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I
247 will think of thee at court.
248 HELENA
249 Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.
250 PAROLLES
251 Under Mars, I.
252 HELENA
253 I especially think, under Mars.
254 PAROLLES
255 Why under Mars?
256 HELENA
257 The wars have so kept you under that you must needs
258 be born under Mars.
259 PAROLLES
260 When he was predominant.
261 HELENA
262 When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
263 PAROLLES
264 Why think you so?
265 HELENA
266 You go so much backward when you fight.
267 PAROLLES
268 That's for advantage.
269 HELENA
270 So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;
271 but the composition that your valour and fear makes
272 in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.
273 PAROLLES
274 I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee
275 acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the
276 which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize
277 thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
278 counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon
279 thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and
280 thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When
281 thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast
282 none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,
283 and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.
284 Exit
285 
286 HELENA
287 Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
288 Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky
289 Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
290 Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
291 What power is it which mounts my love so high,
292 That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
293 The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
294 To join like likes and kiss like native things.
295 Impossible be strange attempts to those
296 That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
297 What hath been cannot be: who ever strove
298 So show her merit, that did miss her love?
299 The king's disease--my project may deceive me,
300 But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.
301 Exit
